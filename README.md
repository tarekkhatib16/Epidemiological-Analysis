# R Project

In this project I modelled data given to me using the SIR model. The SIR model is an epidemiological model that allows us to see the theoretical number of infected people.

The system occurs in 3 differential equations:

*dS/dt = -BSI*

*dI/dt = BSI - YI*

*dR/dt = YI*

I used the above 3 equations to visualise the data.
